A Custom Callout for MapKit.


Description
=============
The objectives:
* being able to easily insert your own custom view as a callout
* when the callout is displayed you should still be able to interact with the map
* being able to create multiple types of pins
* being able to attach events to the map callout
* when the callout is displayed on the edges of the map, the map should be moved just enough so that the callout can be correctly displayed
